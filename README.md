#FEMRI

This library is an extension of the original FEMRI library by Luca Antiga and David Steinman.

It is able to simulate MRI image aquisition by computing the Fourier transform of a volume bounded by linear or quadratic triangular surface elements using numerical quadrature. It can also compute an a priori error estimate for a desired number of quadrature points. This library can also generate any number of quadrature points by using the [Golub-Welsch] (http://web.stanford.edu/class/cme335/spr11/S0025-5718-69-99647-1.pdf) algorithm implemented using VTK functions.

This extended library and its uses are explained in detail in my Master's [Thesis] (https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/67855).
